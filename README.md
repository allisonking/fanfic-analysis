# fanfic-analysis

This repository is for collecting and analyzing the data from [Fanction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net), specifically about Harry Potter fan fiction.

The repository [here](https://github.com/smilli/fanfiction) served as a foundation for a lot of the scraping done here. I ended up modifying their code to suit my needs and also to parse a different subset of data, but their work was very useful for me to get started. 

More notes to come...
